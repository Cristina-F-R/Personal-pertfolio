That's a personal project I'm making to present myself while I'm looking for job oportunities. It's a personal portfolio where people can take a look at all the interesting projects I've made until now.

That's a project that's still in construction. the version you can visit right now it's just a simplified version of what I have in mind.
One of the ideas I have is to add a dinamic page where the user'll be able to consult each project in detail. I'll improve the SASS and I'll add some links to access directly to the demo of the web, to github and a lot more! 

##Techonologies:

The technologies that have been used are: 

- HTML
- SASS
- React
- Gulp
